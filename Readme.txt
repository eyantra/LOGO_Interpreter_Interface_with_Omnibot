LOGO Interpreter Interface with Omnibot 
--------------------------------------------------------

Introduction:
-----------------
	 In this project, we take the standard 'ucblogo' implementation of LOGO interpreter and interface it with the firebird omni-directional bot. LOGO is a complete programming language with power equal to LISP, but it is mainly used to draw graphics and has very intuitive and easy commands to draw graphics. We had to create a system such that given a LOGO program the bot draws the same figure on a paper as the program directs.
